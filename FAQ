Frequently Asked Questions About MICO


Q:  During compilation my gcc dies with an
    "internal compiler error". What is going wrong?
A:  Some Linux distributions are coming with a broken version of
  gcc that calls itself gcc 2.96. You will have to "downgrade" to gcc
  2.95.x. See below for a note on gcc 3.0.



Q:  MICO seems to compile, but then the IDL compiler crashes.
    What is going wrong?
A:  This is an error you are likely to experience with gcc 3.0. This
  gcc version is buggy, resulting in wrong code. You cannot use MICO with
  gcc 3.0. Bug reports have been filed with the gcc database. At the moment,
  you will have to downgrade to gcc 2.95.x.



Q:  gcc still dies with an "internal compiler error".
A:  You are encouraged to submit a bug report to the appropriate
  compiler's mailing list. In the meantime, disabling optimization
  usually works.

  
     ./configure --disable-optimize
  



Q:  During compilation gcc dies with a "virtual memory
    exhausted" error.  What can I do?

A:  Add more swap space. Under Linux you can simply create a
  swap file:
  
  
     su
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swapfile bs=1024 count=64000
     mkswap /tmp/swapfile
     swapon /tmp/swapfile
  

  There are similar ways for other unix flavors. Ask your sys admin.
  If for some reason you cannot add more swap space, try turning off
  optimization by rerunning configure: ./configure
    --disable-optimize.

  We recommend at least 64 Megabytes of physical memory for compiling
  MICO or for development based on MICO. Ready-to-run MICO applications
  have a much smaller memory footprint.



Q:  I'm using gcc. Compliation aborts with an error message
  from the assembler (as) such as
  
     /usr/ccs/bin/as: error: can't compute value of an expression
     involving an external symbol
  

A:  This is a bug in the assember which cannot handle long symbol
  names. The preferred solution is to install the GNU assembler (from the
  binutils package). In the meantime, you can try to enable debugging

  
     ./configure --enable-debug
  

  You can also try to use MICO's lightweight MiniSTL package instead of
  your system's STL library:

  
     ./configure --enable-mini-stl
  



Q:  Why do MICO programs fail with a COMM_FAILURE
    exception when running on `localhost'?
A:  Because MICO requires using your `real' host name. Never use
    `localhost' in an address specification.



Q:  MICO programs crash. Why?
  
A:  There is no easy answer (what did you expect?). But often
  this is caused by linking in wrong library versions. For example
  people often install egcs as a second compiler in their system and
  set PATH such that egcs will be picked. But that is not enough: You
  have to make sure that gcc's C++ libraries (esp. libstdc++) will be
  linked in. One way to make MICO use a gcc installed in
  /usr/local/gcc is:

  
     export PATH=/usr/local/gcc/bin:$PATH
     export CXXFLAGS=-L/usr/local/gcc/lib
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./configure
  
  
  If that is not the cause you probably found a bug in MICO. Write a
  mail to mico@vsb.cs.uni-frankfurt.de containing a
  description of the problem, along with

  
  - the MICO version (make sure it is the latest by visiting
       http://www.mico.org/)
  - the operating system you are running on
  - the hardware you are running on
  - the compiler type and version you are using
  - a stack trace
  - To get a stack trace run the offending program in the
    debugger:
    
      gdb <prog>
      (gdb) run <args>
      program got signal ???
      (gdb) backtrace
    
    and include the output in your mail.
  



Q:  After creating Implementation Repository entries with
    imr create imr list does not show the newly created entries. What
    is going wrong?
  
A:  You must tell imr where micod is running,
  otherwise imr will create its own implementation repository which is
  destroyed when imr exits. You tell imr the location of the
  implementation repository by using the -ORBImplRepoAddr
  option, e.g.:
  
     micod -ORBIIOPAddr inet:jade:4242 &
     imr -ORBImplRepoAddr inet:jade:4242
  



Q:  Why don't exceptions work on Linux?
A:  They do. You are experiencing a bug in the
  assembler. Upgrade to binutils-2.8.1.0.15 or newer and recompile
  MICO.
