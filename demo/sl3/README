In this directory you can find various MICO SL3 demos. All demos
might be divided into two categories: transport security demos and
security level 3 demos.


Transport Security demos
------------------------
These demos demonstrate working with credentials directly on the
transport layer. The supported transport layers are plain TCPIP and
SSL/TLS.

Demos:

tcpip: this demo demonstrates working with plain TCPIP/IIOP protocol

tls: this demo demonstrates working with the SSL/TLS protocol

tls-anon: this demo demonstrates working with the SSL/TLS protocol,
          where client does not have its own certificate and so
          initiates so called anonymous TLS connection

tls-naming: this demo demonstrates combined usage of both TCPIP and
            SSL/TLS protocols. The TCPIP protocol is used to
            obtain/set server object reference from/into naming
            service and SSL/TLS protocol is then used for
            communication between client and server.

Security Level 3 demos
----------------------
These demos demonstrate working with credentials in SAS (CSIv2)
protocol layers. Security Level 3 credentials are always build upon
some supported transport layer and so they internally use transport
layer's credentials. All demos in this category demonstrate simple
CSIv2 GSS user-password authentication scheme usage.

user-pass-tcpip: this demo demonstrates working with security level 3
                 credentials on top of TCPIP transport layer

user-pass-tls: this demo demonstrates working with security level 3
               credentials on top of TLS transport layer

user-pass-tls-anon: this demo demonstrates working with security level
                    3 credentials on top of TLS transport layer where
                    client uses anonymous SSL/TLS connections.

user-pass-tcpip-identity: this demo demonstrates usage of
                          QuotingPrincipal functionality on top of
                          TCPIP transport layer

user-pass-tls-plain-tls-client: this demo demonstrates ability of
                                security service to establish context
                                based on transport credentials



SL3 to CSIv2 demos mapping
--------------------------
This table illustrates which SL3 demo is counterpart to which CSIv2
demo.
